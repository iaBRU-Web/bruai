1. INTRODUCTION
Energy is essential for daily human activities such as cooking, heating, lighting, and food preservation. In many communities, especially in developing regions, charcoal remains the most commonly used fuel for cooking because it is easy to obtain and simple to use. However, the widespread use of charcoal has serious negative effects on both human health and the environment. Burning charcoal releases smoke, carbon dioxide, and other harmful gases that pollute the air and contribute to respiratory diseases. In addition, large-scale charcoal production leads to deforestation, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.
Solar energy is a renewable, clean, and sustainable source of energy that comes directly from the Sun. Unlike charcoal, solar energy does not produce smoke, does not require cutting down trees, and does not run out. This makes solar energy a very important alternative energy source for the future. One practical way of using solar energy at a small scale is through a solar oven.
This project focuses on the design, construction, testing, and evaluation of a solar oven made from locally available and low-cost materials. The solar oven captures sunlight and converts it into thermal energy that can be used for cooking food or heating water. Through this project, we apply physics concepts of heat transfer and energy transformation while also addressing real-life environmental and social challenges.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Charcoal stoves are widely used because they are familiar and relatively cheap in the short term. However, their long-term effects are harmful. The main problems caused by charcoal stoves include:
• Air pollution and smoke-related diseases such as coughing, asthma, and eye irritation
• Deforestation due to excessive cutting of trees for charcoal production
• Increased household expenses due to continuous purchase of charcoal
• Contribution to global warming through the release of carbon dioxide
These challenges create an urgent need for cleaner and more sustainable cooking methods. This project investigates whether a solar oven can reduce dependence on charcoal by providing a safe, affordable, and environmentally friendly alternative that uses free solar energy.
3. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT
The main objectives of this project are:
• To design and build a functional solar oven using simple, locally available materials
• To apply the principles of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation
• To measure and compare the temperature inside the solar oven with the outside temperature
• To determine the time taken to heat 1 liter of water by 10°C using solar energy
• To compare solar energy with other renewable and non-renewable energy sources
• To evaluate how the use of a solar oven can reduce environmental and health problems caused by charcoal stoves
These objectives help link theoretical physics concepts with practical real-life applications.

4. HYPOTHESIS
a) The temperature inside the solar oven will be significantly higher than the temperature outside the oven.
b) The successful use of the solar oven will directly address problems associated with charcoal stoves and will be more sustainable than non-renewable energy sources.
5. MATERIALS AND TOOLS USED
The following materials were used to construct the solar oven:
• Cardboard boxes (inner and outer box)
• Aluminium foil (reflective surface)
• Cotton wool (insulation)
• Black paper or black-painted surface (absorber)
• Transparent plastic or glass sheet (cover)
• Tape and glue
• Scissors or cutter
• Thermometer
• Stopwatch or clock
• 1-liter container with water
These materials were chosen because they are affordable, locally available, and environmentally friendly.

6. PRINCIPLES OF HEAT TRANSFER APPLIED
The solar oven works using three main heat transfer mechanisms:
Radiation: Solar energy from the Sun enters the oven and is reflected by aluminium foil onto the black surface.
Conduction: Heat is transferred through the pot and water.
Convection: Hot air is trapped inside the oven, reducing heat loss.
7. VARIABLES IN THE EXPERIMENT
The table below shows the variables used in the experiment.

The independent variable affects the dependent variable, while controlled variables ensure a fair test.

9. TEMPERATURE PREDICTION
We predicted that the solar oven would reach a temperature of 70°C – 90°C under strong sunlight.
• Average outside temperature: 28°C – 32°C
• Expected temperature difference: 40°C – 60°C higher inside the oven
10. DATA COLLECTION AND RESULTS
During testing, temperature readings were recorded at regular time intervals.

Calculation: Heating 1 Liter of Water by 10°C
Initial water temperature = 30°C
Final water temperature = 40°C
Temperature change (ΔT) = 10°C
From the table, the temperature increased from 30°C to 40°C in 20 minutes.
Time taken to heat 1 liter of water by 10°C = 20 minutes

11. OUTPUT POWER OF THE SOLAR OVEN
Energy required to heat water:
Q = m × c × ΔT
Where:
• m = 1 kg (1 liter of water)
• c = 4200 J/kg°C
• ΔT = 10°C
Q = 1 × 4200 × 10 = 42,000 J
Time = 20 minutes = 1200 seconds
Power = Q / t = 42,000 / 1200 = 35 W
Estimated power output of the solar oven = 35 watts

12. DISCUSSION: HEAT TRANSFER IN THE SOLAR OVEN
The successful operation of the solar oven depends on the combined action of radiation, conduction, and convection.
Radiation: Solar radiation from the Sun enters the oven through the transparent plastic or glass cover. The aluminium foil reflectors direct and concentrate more sunlight into the oven. The black surface inside the oven absorbs most of this radiation and converts it into heat energy.
Conduction: Once heat is absorbed, it is transferred through direct contact. Heat moves from the black surface to the cooking container and then to the water inside the container. This process allows the temperature of the water to increase gradually.
Convection: As the air inside the oven heats up, it becomes less dense and circulates within the enclosed space. The transparent cover and insulation reduce heat loss by preventing hot air from escaping. Cotton wool acts as an insulator, slowing down heat loss to the surroundings.
Together, these three heat transfer processes trap thermal energy inside the solar oven, allowing it to reach temperatures much higher than the surrounding environment.
13. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF THE SOLAR OVEN
The solar oven:
• Reduces air pollution
• Reduces deforestation
• Improves health by reducing smoke inhalation
• Uses free and renewable solar energy
This makes it more sustainable than charcoal stoves.

14. IMPROVEMENTS TO THE DESIGN
The solar oven can be improved by:
• Using better insulation materials
• Increasing reflector size
• Using double glass covers
• Improving reflector angle adjustment
• Using metal cooking pots
15. CONCLUSION
The solar oven project successfully demonstrated that solar energy can be harnessed using simple materials to produce useful heat for cooking and heating water. The experimental results showed that the temperature inside the solar oven was significantly higher than the outside temperature, which supports the stated hypothesis.
The project also showed that solar ovens can help reduce dependence on charcoal, thereby reducing air pollution, deforestation, and health risks associated with smoke inhalation. Since solar energy is renewable, free, and environmentally friendly, solar ovens are more sustainable than non-renewable energy sources such as charcoal.
In conclusion, the solar oven is a practical example of how physics principles can be applied to solve real-world problems. With further improvements, solar ovens can play an important role in promoting clean energy use and protecting the environment.
